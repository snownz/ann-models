# ANN models and Samples

## Model 1 -> Memory LSTM

System 1: Organizes input information all the time, reinforcing experiences already seen and always bringing as much information as possible on a given stimulus.

System 2: Process information as subconscious help, most often taking as truth what came from the subconscious or pondering.

This architecture is based on some facts, such as a non-volatile memory that stores input information along with information about the input, a volatile and temporal memory that each X-timings compresses this information and passes it to memory (System 1). The general idea is based on some thoughts of scientists such as Daniel Kahneman, who describes the two systems and George Miller who describes that short-term memory has a limit to saturate and for that it is necessary that it becomes a context and that between in the long term memory.

This model is an INITIAL idea, more details as the model develops better.
